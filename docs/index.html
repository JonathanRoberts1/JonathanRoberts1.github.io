        <h2>Hello, I am currently interested in the Entry Level Rx Benefit Database Administrator & Data Analyst position and thought this may be better than an ordinary cover letter. After reviewing the position I believe I would be a great fit for the company. Working with the healthcare industry is something I have in an interest in doing. I have communication skills along with skills in several softwares including C#, and SQL. I have learned to be a great communicator with my lead job with IMMY labs where I manage the sites in which people come to get vaccinated. </h2>
